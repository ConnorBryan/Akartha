# AKARTHA
## Concepts
### This is a listing of concepts unique to the world of Akartha.

## Thalkoum
> The Thalkoum (plural Thalkouma) are specialized robotic devices powered by The Glow. These machines were originally developed by the Sharzim as more efficient infrastructure developers, but were quickly modified to act as machines of war.
> There are many different models of Thalkoum, but all share similar features:

* Unconscious piloting: any creature afflicted with The Glow is capable of sacrificing consciousness in order to pilot the Thalkoum. This process is achieved primarily through "thinking" what one wants the Thalkoum to accomplish.
* A liquid energy source: typically stored on the back of the machine in tamper-proof "glass barrels", this liquid drains as the Thalkoum moves around and performs attacks. Can be charged through special connectors that are relatively rare throughout Akartha, and slightly more common in Sharzim-infested realms.
* _Beam attack_: Force damage to a single target within 60'. Uses 4% charge.
* _Concussive blast_: Area-of-Effect damage affecting every tile around the impact point within 60'. Uses 6% charge.
* _Telekinetic prowess_: Control things mentally with great strength within 40'. Uses 4% charge.
* _Lightning (certain models)_: A single-target lightning bolt dealing a wide range of damage within 60'. Uses 7% charge.
* _Chain lightning (certain models)_: A single-target lightning bolt that spreads to all targets within 10' and continues, within range 60'. Deals a wide range of damage. Uses 9% charge.
* _Weapon manipulation (certain models)_: Certain Thalkouma have a custom weapon with its own properties and stats (e.g. a drill) .

### Models
__Mark I__
The Mark I Thalkoum posseses a single "glass barrel" for an energy source, is easier to hit, and can only perform the beam attack. These are the lowest cost machines and are typically given to Sharzim grunts.

__Stats__
* HP: 72
* AC: 13
* DC: 4
* DEX: 11
* Speed: 50'
* Beam power: 2d8
* Maximum charge: 100%

__Mark II__
The Mark II Thalkoum is a slightly beefier version of the Mark I and has two "glass barrels" for extra charge. It has access to all of the standard attacks.

__Stats__
* HP: 102
* AC: 14
* DC: 5
* DEX: 13
* Speed: 50'
* Beam power: 3d8 + 2
* Concussive blast power: 2d8 + 2
* Maximum charge: 150%

__Mark IIb__
A varian of the Mark II, the Mark IIb is a security-focused yellow model that provides lightning attack capabilities and preventative measures for would-be hijackers.

__Stats__
* HP: 88
* AC: 13
* DC: 5
* DEX: 13
* Speed: 60'
* Beam power: 2d8 + 5
* Concussive blast power: 2d8 + 2
* Lightning: 3d10
* Chain lightning: 3d10
* Maximum charge: 150%

__Mark III__
The Mark III Thalkoum is also a double-barreled machine, but has a drill-based weapon that can cut through most materials.

__Stats__
* HP: 121
* AC: 15
* DC: 6
* DEX: 12
* Speed: 50'
* Beam power: 3d8 + 5
* Concussive blast power: 2d8 + 5
* Drillbit: 3d8 physical damage
* Maximum charge: 150%
